# Grain globber

- Approx. completion time: **1 hour**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, 1 CSS file, 1 JS file, images**

---

**With an already made array of grains, create a layout in the HTML with jQuery & CSS.**

- *Fork this repository.*
- The information is inside an array of objects in the `grains.js` file.
- Loop over the `grains` variable and use jQuery to output `<li>` tags into the `<ul>` that’s already in the HTML file.
- Each `<li>` tag should have an `<img>`, an `<h2>`, & a `<p>`
- Style the Javascript generated list using CSS—the selectors are all ready.
- **DO NOT change the HTML.**
- **DO NOT change `grains.js`**
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
